### How to run

1. Create Python virtual environment:

```
python3 -m venv foo
```

2. Activate virtual environment

   - Linux: `. PATH/TO/venv_name/bin/activate`
   - Windows (PowerShell): `. .\PATH\TO\venv_name\Scripts\activate`
   - Windows (Command Prompt): `>PATH\TO\venv_name\Scripts\activate`
   - macOS: `source PATH/TO/venv_name/bin/activate`

   *Notes*

### FEATURE SPOTLIGHT
* AI Prompting at line 64 in file `__init__.py`
* AI API Integration in file `AI.py`
* Database Population using API in `FMP.py`
* Data is parsed in `graphloading.py`, then passed in `static/tesla_charts.js` for displaying the graph.

### KNOWN BUGS/ISSUES
* AI Does not take context (i.e. the recent tweets) into its analysis.
* Images/videos in the tweet are not rendered in tweet analysis, which may influence predictions.
* Original tweet of retweets are not factored into tweet analysis.
