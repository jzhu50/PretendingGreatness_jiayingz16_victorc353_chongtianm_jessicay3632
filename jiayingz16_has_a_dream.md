* 0site: https://www.astrosage.com/
* 0why: Growing up, I've always liked astrology as a means to spend time when I'm bored. I would analyze my compatibility with my friends/family/teachers/strangers I just met. I don't take the results seriously (I promise) but it's a great use of time (or is it?). Anyhow, astrology is my childhood, and I'm sure there is a market for AI astrology nowadays, as more and more people demand personalized readings online... 
* 0how: I will probably mimic the website, but I also want to add some exclusive functionalities.
* 0moxie: 5? It doesn't seem too impossible to achieve but I might have to dig deeper into astrology.

* 1moxie: {1..10} (How audacious is your idea? 10 is so daring and fraught with risk that the possibility of failure is high... while 1 is so trivial you could have done it in October.)
